===========

Quick practice project for getting to grips with Node.js. Simple concurrent web chat application.

Install
-------

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone repo to chosen directory.
3. From directory run: `npm install` to install dependencies.

Usage
-----

1. From directory run: `node index.js` to start server.
2. Server listens on localhost:8080 by default, go here in a browser to open a new client instance.

Enjoy

This practice project was put together quickly to familiarise myself with node which I had never used before. I put a bit of thought into avoiding concurrency bugs but I'm sure I might have missed some so if you break it then please let me know.
